# The Goblin Market

Periodically I try out a new game library. This is my attempt to learn the Godot Engine.

## Resources

I'm using the Marius1 font from "https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/marius1". I'm not having any luck figuring out who "Marius" is but it's always wonderful when somebody publishes a CC0 font.

I've also grabbed a couple of high-quality fonts from Sora Sagano's [DotColon](https://dotcolon.net/). These are also CC0.

In general, I'm trying to put together "clean" code and art so that other folks can modify my work without legal impediments. For the same reason, all original code and artwork here are CC0 licensed. Use them as you like.

There's a lot more artwork out there under the CC-BY license. If you look at users of it like The Mana World and the other Liberated Pixel Cup projects, you'll see the problem quite quickly - you have to individually track every piece of artwork and credit it from the UI. That's a nontrivial undertaking, and it becomes absolutely *huge* rapidly if your project has any size to it.

I *do* think it's wonderful to give credit to artists. But I think that telling people they have to and then making it very difficult is optimizing for a world where only lawbreakers prosper. DikuMUD had that problem back in the day and I don't want to reproduce that problem again.
